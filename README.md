PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS FOR ONLINE NEWS POPULARITY
 
This project focuses on developing models to analyze and predict the factors that influence the popularity of online news articles and identify patterns that may affect readership. The goal is to uncover the key drivers behind article popularity and provide actionable insights for content creators and digital publishers. To achieve this, various factors such as token count, publication day of the week, news categories, sentiment polarities, and the number of positive and negative words were considered. Several regression models, including linear regression, Poisson regression, random forest, artificial neural networks, and XGBoost, were implemented to analyze and predict these metrics.
