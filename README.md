PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS FOR ONLINE NEWS POPULARITY

In this project, we aim to build models that help understand the factors that contribute to the
popularity of online news articles and identify patterns that may influence readership. With this
project, we aim to uncover key drivers of article popularity and provide actionable
recommendations for content creators and digital publishers. Various metrics like tokens, the day
of the week the article was published, categories of news, polarities, number of positive and
negative words, etc. were taken into consideration while implementing various models for
regression namely linear regression, Poisson regression, random forest, Artificial Neural
Networks, and XGBoost.
